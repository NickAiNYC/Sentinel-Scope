# 🛡️ SentinelScope
**AI-Augmented Compliance Agent for NYC Construction**

*Turn insurance renewal "fire drills" into automated evidence workflows*

## 🎯 The Problem
NYC general contractors spend **40-80 hours per project** scrambling during DOB inspections and insurance renewals—manually searching thousands of unstructured OpenSpace captures to prove milestone completion.

## 🚀 The Solution
SentinelScope automates construction compliance evidence indexing with an LLM-powered pipeline:
📤 Upload → 🧠 AI Classification → ⚠️ Gap Detection → 📄 Report Generation → 🚨 Risk Alerts
